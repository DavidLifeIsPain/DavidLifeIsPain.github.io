                    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is more than a health crisis; it is an economic crisis,
                        a humanitarian crisis, a security crisis, and a human rights crisis.
                        This crisis has highlighted severe fragilities and inequalities within
                        and among nations. Coming out of this crisis will require a whole-of-society,
                        whole-of-government and whole-of-the-world approach driven by compassion and solidarity.

                      If you're infected with COVID-19 and have been asked to care for yourself
                      at home or if you're a caregiver to someone who has COVID-19 and are caring
                      for them at home, how would you keep everyone safe? Hello and welcome to Science
                      in 5. I'm Vismita Gupta-Smith. These are WHO's conversations in science. And Dr.
                      April Baller is going to explain to us today how to care safely for a COVID-19 patient at home.

                    <p>
                      The WHO Emergency Use Listing process determines whether a product can be
                      recommended for use based on all the available data on safety and efficacy
                      and on its suitability in low- and middle-income countries. Vaccines are assessed
                      to ensure they meet acceptable standards of quality, safety and efficacy using clinical
                      trial data, manufacturing and quality control processes. The assessment weighs the threat posed by
                      the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.
