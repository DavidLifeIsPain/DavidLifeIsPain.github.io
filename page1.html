                         Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
                         Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory
                         illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become
                         seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying
                         medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,
                         or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19
                         and become seriously ill or die at any age. The best way to prevent and slow down
                         transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads.
                         Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
                         wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently.
                         Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance. The virus can spread
                         from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak,
                         sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
                         It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow,
                         and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

                         The evidence so far indicates that the virus is spread from person to person
                         through small respiratory droplets. When a person coughs or sneezes, these
                         droplets can also land on nearby surfaces. There is also evidence that the COVID-19
                         virus can last on surfaces – especially plastic or metal – for up to 3 days.
                         This is why advice to avoid catching COVID-19 has focused on handwashing with soap,
                         the use of alcohol-based hand sanitising gels and keeping a distance from people who are symptomatic

                         When someone is vaccinated, they are very likely to be protected against the targeted disease.
                         But not everyone can be vaccinated. People with underlying health conditions that weaken their
                         immune systems (such as cancer or HIV) or who have severe allergies to some vaccine components
                         may not be able to get vaccinated with certain vaccines. These people can still be protected if
                         they live in and amongst others who are vaccinated. When a lot of people in a community are vaccinated
                         the pathogen has a hard time circulating because most of the people it encounters are immune.
                         So the more that others are vaccinated, the less likely people who are unable to be protected by
                         vaccines are at risk of even being exposed to the harmful pathogens. This is called herd immunity.

                                           To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                         Maintain a safe distance from others (at least 1 metre), even if they don’t appear to be sick.
                         Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
                         Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
                         Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
                         Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
                         Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
                         Stay home if you feel unwell.
